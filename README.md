# Optical_Communications-2019

A set of three (3) seperate projects dealing with:
  - Part I: Analysis of Modes in rib waveguide using the Effective Index Method & Analysis of Modes in Optical Fiber
  - Part II: Calculation of Dispersion Coefficients in the SMF-28 Optical Fiber & Simulated Transimission of Bit-Stream through an Optical Fiber
  - Part III: Simulation of Laser Diode Output
